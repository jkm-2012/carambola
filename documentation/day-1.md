# Day 1 - my carambola arrived
Last week I read an article about [Carambola](http://www.8devices.com/product/3/carambola "Carambola"), a tiny small [MIPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture "MIPS on Wikipedia") based mini computer. I read this article in german famous computer magazine [CT](http://www.heise.de/ct/inhalt/2012/20/80/ "Link to article").

So I considered a few days and finally after I ordered one Carambola with the developer board on Wednesday. Ordering process was very easy, just enter your adress and pay with Paypal. Finally the whole order was about 55 Euro including delivery cost and VAT, so a fair price for my new nerd toy. 

On Friday I received a mail from 8devices that my order is now shipped and on Tuesday the next week I finally got it delivered via German DHL. All in all everything was just in time.

Very exciting I opened the package and was a little bit disappointed. Only the Carambola mounted on the developer board and the invoice. Nothing more, no more information, datasheet or something else. 

First thing I remembered was the missing headers for GPIO. Only the holes in the PCB. Hmm... so I have to order a 2x10 Header block and solder it. Not that what I expected on a developer board. 

Well, the next question I had what about power supply. Because of missing datasheet I visited their website and the forum. In the forum a few people asked for the power supply and finally you need a supply:
+ 9-24V DC
+ at least 0.5A
+ ground is outside
+ plus is in the middle

So I've to search in my workbench if I have a proper power supply. 

I'm really exciting to see it running, so stay tuned. Will be continued.
